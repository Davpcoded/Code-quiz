#PseudoCode

- I want to create a code quiz that presents an introduction to the quiz as first page.
- When the user starts the quiz it also starts a timer
- Then I want to present questions to the user with simple select answers.
- When a question is answered correctly the user gets a notification and moves to the next question.
- When a question is answered correctly, it will give the user scorepoints
- When it's incorrect it will also alert the user and will take 10 seconds from the timer.
- After all questions are answered or the timemark gets to 0 the user will be asked to submit their names.
- Then the page will tell the user the final score and put it in a scoreboard.
